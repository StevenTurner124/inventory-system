Inventory System

Description
The first project I was tasked with creating was an inventory system using C++. It utilizes FXML for layout design inside of the IntelliJ IDEA. When the program runs, it opens a screen showing current inventory levels and pricing for products and parts. You can modify the current information from the screen upon selecting a part or product and clicking the modify button. It also supports adding new products and parts, both in-house and outsourced, in-house has a Machine ID, whereas outsourced has a company ID to track where it came from. By selecting a product or part from the table, you may delete it using the delete button; however, if a product has associated parts, then it will not be deleted. The part must be removed from the associated parts list to delete the product. A simple search bar at the top allows the table to be parsed.

Uses
The project is an inventory system that could be used by a business looking for a simplified way of tracking its inventory levels. It is simple to use and requires minimal resources to run. With clearly labeled buttons, it would be easy to train someone.

Technology
The layout utilizes FXML with the built-in design option in IntelliJ IDEA. The coding is done in  C++ to manipulate the buttons and other functions.
